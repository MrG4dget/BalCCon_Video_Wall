# BalcCon_Video_Wall

First built at the BalcCon2k17 conference in Novi Sad, Serbia, this project is meant to be as easy to build as possible.
This project grew by the community and is meant to provide people who would like to recreate it with a starting guide.


This BalcCon Video Wall installation was designed with the following priorities in mind:
- Cost effective as possible
- Minimal use of special equipment (some soldering required)
- Easy and fast to deploy and dismantle
- Having fun building it



The following project was the inspiration for the BalcCon Video Wall.

# Overview

The base for the wall consists of 4x8 0.5l bottle crates. The crates provide stability and (if only needed temporarely, might be borrowed or rented at a local beverage supplier). 640 seperately adressable LEDs (Type WS2811), controlled by a single Teensy 3.2 microcontroller board on a OctoWS2811 adapter, are split-up in 8 segments, each covering two lines.
